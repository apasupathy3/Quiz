Team Treehouse iOS Development Tech Degree Project 2 - Enhancing a Quiz App in iOS

SUMMARY: Given a simple true/false quiz app, complete the following:

TASK 1: Refactor code
- Convert collection types into custom classes or structs
- Adhere to Model-View-Controller design pattern more fully
- Convert Storyboard to universal scene and add constraints to maintain layout

TASK 2: Add mandatory features
- Create ability to accomodate four answer choices
- During each game, questions are chosen at random
- No question repeated within single game
- Implement at least one of the optional features below

TASK 3: Add optional features (AT LEAST THREE)
- Add two sound effects: one for correct answer, one for incorrect answer (can add more sounds in other places, e.g. at end of game)
- Create "lightning" mode: user only has 15 seconds to select answer
- Display correct answer when player answers incorrectly
- Neatly display a mix of 3-option questions and 4-option questions; inactive buttons spaced/resized properly, not just hidden
- Convert text-based question system to one that dynamically generates arithmetic problems/solutions (i.e., create multiplication/addition quiz that doesn't rely on hard-coded questions)

NOTE: WILL BE CREATING APP FROM SCRATCH BECAUSE FAILED TO DOWNLOAD ORIGINAL QUIZ APP
